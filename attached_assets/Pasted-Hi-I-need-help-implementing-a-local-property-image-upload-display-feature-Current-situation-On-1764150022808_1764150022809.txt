Hi! I need help implementing a local property image upload + display feature.

Current situation

On the “Property Hub” page I have:

Hostaway Properties → these already show their own images with a slider.

Local Properties → these currently show a demo / placeholder image on the property card, even though I didn’t upload any images.

I want my own uploaded images for local properties to be shown on the local property cards, similar to Hostaway cards.

Goal

For local properties only:

On the local property “View Details” page, add an image upload section where I can upload one or more images for that property.

Save these uploaded images (using the same upload/storage mechanism already used elsewhere in the project – e.g., Cloudinary / existing file uploader).

Store the image URLs in the backend/database linked to that specific local property.

On the local property cards in the Property Hub, show those uploaded images:

If there is one image, show that image instead of the demo image.

If there are multiple images, show a slider on the card (left/right arrows) similar to the Hostaway properties image slider.

If there are no uploaded images, keep using the current demo/placeholder image.

Do not change the Hostaway properties behavior.

Implementation details (what I’d like you to do)

Backend / Database

Identify the model used for local properties (e.g., Property, LocalProperty, etc.).

Add a field to store multiple image URLs, e.g.:

images as a string array / JSON array (depending on ORM/DB).

Create/update an API endpoint for uploading and saving property images:

Input: property ID + uploaded file(s).

Output: list of stored image URLs.

Ensure images are uploaded via whatever storage solution the project already uses (Cloudinary / S3 / local uploads). Please reuse existing upload utilities/services instead of adding a new approach.

Property View Details Page (Local Property)

Add an “Images” section on the local property details page only.

Include:

File input for uploading one or multiple images.

“Upload” button that calls the new API endpoint.

Show a small preview gallery of already uploaded images for that property.

Make sure:

Uploading images updates the backend.

After successful upload, the UI refreshes the list of images for that property (without full page reload if possible).

Local Property Card on Property Hub

Locate the component that renders local property cards on the Property Hub.

Replace the hardcoded/demo image with logic that:

Uses the property’s images array if it exists and has items.

Falls back to the current demo/placeholder image if images is empty or undefined.

If images.length > 1, implement a simple slider on the card:

Reuse the same slider pattern used for Hostaway properties (same transition/behavior if possible).

Show previous/next arrows on hover or always visible (match existing style).

Keep transitions smooth and responsive.

General Requirements

Do not break or change existing workflows:

Don’t modify Hostaway property image logic.

Don’t change any routes, IDs, or business logic.

Keep changes scoped to:

Local property model / API.

Local property details page.

Local property card component.

Follow the existing coding style (TypeScript/React/Tailwind, etc.).

Testing

Test with a few local properties:

Case 1: No images → card shows current demo image.

Case 2: One uploaded image → card shows that image.

Case 3: Multiple uploaded images → card shows slider and correctly cycles through uploaded images.

Confirm that Hostaway properties still behave exactly as before.

Finally, please tell me:

Which files you modified/created.

Any environment variables or config I need to set for image upload.

How to use the new upload feature step by step.

Thank you!
