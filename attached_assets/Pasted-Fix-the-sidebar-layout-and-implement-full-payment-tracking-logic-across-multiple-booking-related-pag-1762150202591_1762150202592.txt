Fix the sidebar layout and implement full payment tracking logic across multiple booking-related pages.

Layout Requirement

The sidebar currently doesn’t expand to full screen width properly.

When the sidebar is collapsed, the main dashboard content should automatically expand to fill the full available width (no blank or unused space).

When the sidebar is expanded, maintain the existing layout.

The Back button must always stay on top of all content, and everything below it should start with a display: flex layout.

Booking Details Page

Display:

How much the customer has made as a partial payment.

The remaining due amount clearly.

Add an input or button that allows marking a booking as fully paid (updating payment status in real time).

If the booking status shows the customer has checked in, display how much payment is still due from that customer.

Individual Booking Page

Display the customer’s:

Partial payments

Total paid amount

Total due amount

These values must update dynamically based on real-time booking data.

Finance Hub & Recent Transactions

Display how much payment is due for each booking.

Show the total due amount across all bookings combined.

When a booking’s payment status changes (like marking full paid), these sections should automatically update to reflect the new due amounts.

UI & Logic Requirements

Support both string and number types for amounts (e.g., "250" or 250).

Ensure all payment amounts are displayed in formatted currency style.

When marking full paid:

Validate that the payment amount cannot exceed the due amount.

Update all related views instantly (Booking Details, Individual Booking, Finance Hub).

Use responsive, mobile-first design principles.

Sidebar collapse transition should be smooth and visually consistent.

Expected Behavior Summary

Collapsing the sidebar makes the dashboard stretch to full width.

Each booking page clearly shows Total, Paid, and Due values.

Finance Hub and Recent Transactions reflect up-to-date due amounts automatically.

Users can mark payments as full or partial easily.

The entire interface remains responsive and intuitive across screen sizes.
