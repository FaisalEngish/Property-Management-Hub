Hi Replit Team 👋

We’re experiencing a critical data persistence and synchronization issue in HostPilotPro’s Property Management Hub.

🧩 Current Problem

Property information does not retain or update data from previous bookings or assigned tasks.

After creating a new booking or assigning a task, the Property Dashboard refreshes but shows empty/default values — all key stats reset (Last Booking, Occupancy Rate, Monthly Revenue, Maintenance/Revenue, ROI).

The assigned task count also disappears after refresh and does not sync with the Task Management Hub.

Data only updates after a full manual page reload, which breaks the real-time experience.

⚙️ Expected Behavior

Property cards should automatically update and persist real-time data for:

Last Booking Date

Occupancy Rate

Monthly Revenue

Maintenance/Revenue Ratio

ROI and Assigned Task Counts

When a booking or task is created, edited, or deleted, the updated data should reflect instantly — without requiring a page reload.

All dashboard statistics must stay synchronized with the Task Management module and Booking module.

Delete actions should trigger a proper backend request and update the UI immediately.

🧠 What to Check

Ensure that after any booking or task update, a refresh call to /properties/:id/stats or /properties/:id/summary runs automatically.

Verify that property cards subscribe to real-time updates (via WebSocket or manual re-fetch).

Confirm that the frontend isn’t overwriting the state with empty defaults after an update.

Check that Delete button actions send valid requests and return success responses.

✅ Goal

Implement full synchronization between Property Management, Booking, and Task Management modules so that all property data stays consistent in real time — with no manual refresh required.

Please reproduce the issue, identify the root cause, apply the necessary fixes, and confirm once real-time updates and data persistence are functioning as expected.
Do not modify unrelated code or styling.

Thanks,
Farid
