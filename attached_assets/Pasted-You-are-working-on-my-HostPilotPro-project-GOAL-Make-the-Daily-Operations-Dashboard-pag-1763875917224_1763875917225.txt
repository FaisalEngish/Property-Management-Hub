You are working on my HostPilotPro project.

# GOAL

Make the **Daily Operations Dashboard** page fully functional.

URL (dev):  
`/daily-operations`

Tabs on this page:

- Overview
- Departments
- Staff
- Properties
- Task Details

The page already has:

- A date selector (Previous Day / Today / Next Day)
- A “Refresh Data” button
- Tabs for the 5 sections above
- A “Task Details” area that currently says “No tasks found for this date”

I want:

1. All tabs to show **real, live data** coming from existing Tasks / Properties / Staff / Departments in the system.
2. Everything scoped to the **selected date**.
3. Navigation between dates should automatically reload data.
4. Clicking on a task in “Task Details” should open the existing **task detail / edit** modal if one exists (or a simple detail view if not).

Use existing models and APIs for tasks, staff, departments, properties, and finance if present. Do NOT invent new tables unless absolutely required; prefer to reuse the existing schemas.

Follow these steps in order and modify the real project files in this Replit workspace.

## STEP 1 – Locate the Daily Operations page and supporting code

1. Search the repo for `"Daily Operations Dashboard"` and `"No tasks found for this date"`.
2. Identify:
   - The main page component (likely something like `client/src/pages/DailyOperations.tsx` or similar).
   - Any child components that correspond to the tabs: Overview, Departments, Staff, Properties, Task Details.
3. Do NOT delete any JSX; we will wire up logic and data.

## STEP 2 – Understand existing Task / Property / Staff / Department models

1. Search for existing **Task** APIs and types:
   - Look for `task-routes`, `tasks-routes`, `/api/tasks`, or similar.
   - Identify at least:
     - Task ID
     - Title / name
     - Description
     - `dueDate` or `scheduledDate`
     - Status (pending, in-progress, completed, etc.)
     - Priority (if available)
     - `propertyId`
     - `departmentId`
     - `assignedStaffId` / `assigneeId`
2. Identify the **Property**, **Department**, and **Staff** models:
   - Properties: which table + API endpoint (e.g. `/api/properties`).
   - Departments: which table / endpoint (e.g. `/api/departments`).
   - Staff: staff/users/employees table and endpoint (e.g. `/api/staff`, `/api/users`, etc.).
3. We will use these models in aggregations for the dashboard; do NOT create new tables for them.

## STEP 3 – Backend endpoint for Daily Operations data

We need an endpoint that, given a date, returns data summarizing tasks across properties, departments, and staff.

1. Create a new server route file if none exists, e.g.:

   - `server/daily-operations-routes.ts`

2. Mount it in the main server index:

   ```ts
   import dailyOperationsRoutes from "./daily-operations-routes";
   app.use("/api/daily-operations", dailyOperationsRoutes);
