📦 MODULE: Communication System – Internal Chat, Owner Notes, Guest Smart Requests

✅ PART 1: Internal Staff & PM Communication (Slack-integrated or in-app)
- Staff and Portfolio Managers have internal chat threads, grouped by department and/or property
- Admin can:
  - Create/rename/close chats
  - Invite/remove users from chats
  - Mark important chats to log in the property timeline
- Suggested Slack or Discord integration with webhook to log relevant events into property history
- Optional in-app fallback chat (if we don't use Slack), but only visible to logged-in team members
- Logged messages can be attached to specific tasks, guest stays, or property logs

✅ PART 2: Owner ↔ PM Communication
- Each property has a chat-like “Notes & Updates” feed visible to the owner and portfolio manager
- Includes:
  - Maintenance suggestions
  - Task summaries
  - Requests requiring owner approval
- Admin or PM can post updates and tag owners
- Owner can reply, approve, or comment
- Supports attachments (e.g., invoice PDF, image of broken item)

✅ PART 3: Guest Communication (Smart Form System)
- Guests DO NOT get chat inbox — instead:
  - A “Need Help?” button opens smart request form (looks like chat)
- Categories:
  - AC/Water/Electricity problem
  - Request extra cleaning
  - Order services (massage, chef, taxi, etc.)
  - Other
- AI scans request (basic NLP) → Routes to correct team:
  - AC issue → Technician + Supervisor
  - Extra cleaning → Housekeeping + PM
- Smart reply generated instantly (e.g., “Tech on the way within 2 hours”)
- All requests logged into the stay timeline and linked to the correct task

✅ PART 4: WhatsApp or Email Bridge
- Guest requests can trigger WhatsApp Business message or email alert to the assigned PM/staff
- For future guests or concierge:
  - Guest portal can show “Click to Chat via WhatsApp” for real-time human help
  - Auto-fill villa + guest name into chat URL for staff reference

✅ PART 5: Logging & Timeline Integration
- All chat-based messages (internal, owner, guest) can be logged:
  - As property activity log (for ongoing issues)
  - As guest stay log (for complaints or requests)
  - As task log (e.g., AC fix from guest report)
- Logs auto-archived every 30 days (or admin trigger “Create PDF & Upload to Drive”)

✅ Future Optional:
- Voice note support (internal use only)
- Slack → MagicTools bridge bot (use tags like #log-this to sync important messages)

🧠 All smart routing rules and default responses editable by Admin in the back office settings.
