Create a new module in the app called “Guest Portal Smart Requests & AI Chat”.

Core functionality:

1. Add an AI-powered chat interface to the Guest Dashboard. It should feel like a messaging box with a clean UI (like Messenger or Airbnb chat). This interface must be linked to the guest’s reservation (use Hostaway ID or for demo use “Demo1234”).

2. Any message typed by the guest is scanned by AI for intent. If the message relates to a service (e.g. “We want a massage,” “Can we have early check-in?”), it should automatically generate a request ticket linked to their reservation.

3. Admin/Host/Manager sees this request in a notification center with buttons: Accept / Edit / Decline.

4. Once accepted:
  - The service request is visible in the guest dashboard under a new tab: “Confirmed Extras & Requests.”
  - A task is auto-created and assigned to the correct department (e.g. massage → therapist, extra bed → housekeeping).
  - On the internal team side, this is stored inside the guest’s reservation record.

5. Every service request has a field to tag it as:
   - Guest-Billable
   - Owner-Billable
   - Included
   - Complimentary

6. Included and Complimentary are still logged for internal tracking and reporting purposes.

7. From 7 days before check-in, unlock access to:
   - Arrival details form (airport, flight, time)
   - Book services
   - House manual
   - Area recommendations
   - Cleaning and service schedules
   - Optional add-ons

8. Internal team can also manually add requests or services to the reservation, which will then show in the guest’s dashboard too.

9. All service-related actions are timestamped and stored in the reservation history log. These are viewable by Admin, Host, or assigned Portfolio Manager.

10. Bonus: If possible, allow a guest comment to trigger this logic even if typed freely. If not, provide a dropdown with common requests to simplify processing.

Ensure this whole module is modular so it can be upgraded later with:
  - Survey on check-out
  - Review AI suggestions
  - Hostaway chat/API integration if allowed

Start with demo reservation Demo1234 and build out fake tasks, chat history, and responses.
