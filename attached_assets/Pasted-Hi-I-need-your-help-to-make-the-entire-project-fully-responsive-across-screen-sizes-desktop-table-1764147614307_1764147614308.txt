Hi! I need your help to make the entire project fully responsive across screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile) without breaking any existing workflow or logic.

Goal:

Keep all current features, flows, and data handling exactly the same.

Only improve layout/responsiveness so the UI is user-friendly on any device/screen size.

What I want you to do:

Global layout & containers

Review the main layout components (sidebar, top navbar, content area, cards, property hub screens, etc.).

Make sure containers use responsive widths (e.g. max-width, percentage-based, flex/grid) instead of fixed pixel widths where possible.

Ensure horizontal scrolling is avoided on small screens unless absolutely necessary.

Sidebar & navigation

Make the sidebar behave well on small screens:

Either collapse to an icon-only sidebar or become a slide-in/off-canvas menu triggered by a button on mobile.

Ensure navigation items remain accessible and readable.

Do not change any routes or navigation logic; only adjust layout/styling.

Property cards / grids (like Property Hub screen)

Make the property cards layout responsive:

1 column on small screens, 2 columns on medium, 3–4 on large where appropriate.

Ensure images scale correctly and keep aspect ratio on all devices.

Keep the existing carousel behavior and interactions; just ensure it looks good and doesn’t overflow on small viewports.

Typography & spacing

Adjust font sizes, padding, and margins using responsive units or breakpoints so text stays readable on small devices.

Avoid text overflow/clip issues in titles, buttons, and badges.

Buttons, forms, and tables

Make buttons and clickable elements comfortably tappable on mobile (height, spacing).

For any tables or wide content, make them scrollable horizontally on small screens without breaking structure or data.

Do not modify form validation or submission logic, only layout.

Technical constraints

Do not refactor or rename components, hooks, or APIs.

Do not change any business logic or data fetching.

Limit changes to layout classes/CSS and small structural wrappers (divs, flex/grid wrappers) where needed.

Keep existing class names and patterns where possible and extend them with responsive variants instead of replacing everything.

Testing

Test the app in Replit’s preview and browser dev tools for:

Desktop (≥ 1280px)

Tablet (~768–1024px)

Mobile (~375–430px)

Verify:

No layout breaks

No hidden critical actions (buttons, links)

No scrollbars caused by overflow except where intentionally added.

If you need to introduce any global CSS or config changes (like breakpoints), please keep them minimal and consistent with the existing styling approach.

Let me know which files you touched and a quick summary of the main responsive improvements you made.
